Feel free to use this. Have a look through it first and edit where appropriate. There will still need to be some manual things to be done but this should at least be the bulk of it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shmink/personal-setup.git
cd personal-setup
chmod +x set-up.sh
sudo ./set-up.sh
```
